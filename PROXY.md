# Using a Proxy on naticord
You might be using an old operating system such as XP or Vista. You need a proxy to connect to the Discord servers as they use TLS 1.2 and these old operating systems don't support it. We recommend you use [Redex Tiny TLS Proxy](https://github.com/rebexnet/RebexTinyTlsProxy).

Once you get that setup correctly and everything accordingly, you can input your proxy in network settings.
