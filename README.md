Naticord / Native-cord is a native Discord client made in Python.

Why make a native client or even a custom client at all? Well, it's because Discord's half baked web app is **shit**. I want to have a simple yet good experience while having my RAM not being taken by Discord. So this was the answer.

The official Discord app goes to 400MB idle while this can go all the way low to 25MB!

The UI is also sort of inspired Windows Live Messenger (long live WLM)
