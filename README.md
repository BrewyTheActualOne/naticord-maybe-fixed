# naticord
Naticord / Native-cord is a native Discord client made in Python.

Why make a native client or even a custom client at all? Well, it's because Discord's half baked web app is **shit**. I want to have a simple yet good experience while having my RAM not being taken by Discord. So this was the answer.
# Installation
First of all, install the PyQt5 and requests library using
```
pip install PyQt5 requests
```
And then just run `naticord.py`
# What's working
